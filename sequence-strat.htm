			<td>The Late Devonian Chattanooga Shale of Tennessee and Kentucky is 
			in most areas a thin black shale deposit of less than 10 meters 
			thickness. It is a distal equivalent to the almost 3000m thick 
			Catskill sequence, and encompasses most of the Frasnian and 
			Fammenian, approximately 14 million years of earth history.<p>
			Although originally thought of as a continuously, though slowly, 
			deposited deep water shale unit, the Chattanooga Shale shows 
			internal erosion surfaces at various scales as well as storm 
			deposits. These features suggest comparatively shallow water 
			deposition (tens of meters water depth), and a stratigraphic record 
			with numerous interruptions of various duration. A number of erosion 
			surfaces are laterally extensive and can be traced from exposure to 
			exposure through the entire outcrop area (over distances of as much 
			as 300km). Erosion surfaces of this type are considered sequence 
			boundaries sensu Vail, and tracing them has made it possible to 
			subdivide the Chattanooga Shale into as many as 14 sequences.</p>
			<p>These sequence boundaries are very subtle features (see
			<a href="http://mypage.iu.edu/~jschiebe/Main_Pages/table%201,%20erosion%20surfaces.html">
			Table</a>). The following features are indicative of their presence 
			in a given outcrop: 1) sandy, silty, or pyritic lag deposits of up 
			to several cm thickness; 2) sharp-based shale beds; 3) low-angle 
			truncation of shale beds; 4) scoured surfaces; and 5) soft-sediment 
			deformation in underlying shales. Tracing erosion surfaces from 
			outcrop to outcrop is based on a combination of: 1) petrographic 
			matching of lag deposits; 2) the petrography and microfabrics of 
			individual shale packages; 3) conodont data; and 4) gamma ray 
			surveys.</p>
			<p>Collection of further conodont data and extension of this 
			stratigraphic framework to adjacent areas may eventually lead to a 
			comprehensive stratigraphic framework for the entire Late Devonian 
			black shale complex of the eastern US. Comparison between distal and 
			proximal successions may allow differentiation of truly eustatic 
			events from those due to tectonism and sedimentation.</td>
