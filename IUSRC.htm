<b>The IU Shale Research Consortium was founded to provide sustained funding for 
the operation of the IU Shale Research Lab and its facilities, and support for 
ongoing shale research and shale related student research. Pre-Pandemic Sponsors 
were 
Anadarko, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Wintershall, 
Whiting, and Statoil. Current Sponsors are Exxonmobil and Chevron, we are in the 
process of rebuilding.</b><p>There is an ongoing &quot;Boom&quot; of shale gas and oil exploration in the US and overseas, 
but a severe shortage of highly trained professionals that can fill the unique 
needs experienced by shale gas exploration and production. Our research program 
is focused on a fundamental understanding of how muds are deposited, and how 
they become shales and mudstones in the course of diagenesis and burial. The 
results of our research are of interest to academic research into &quot;deep time&quot; 
geologic processes and the resulting rock record, climate research, and 
reconstruction of past worlds, and also to industry geologists that use our 
results to evaluate environments of deposition, basinwide shale distribution, 
and variability of shale properties. </p>
<p>The IU Shale Research Lab is a unique facility that combines high end 
petrographic capabilities (light microscopy, Field Emission Analytical SEM, Ion 
Milling Lab), the only flume lab that was designed to study depositional 
processes of muds, a long track record of benchmark research results, and 30 
years of experience in shale research. We also have on campus access to a state 
of the art stable isotope (S, O, N, H) and metal isotope lab, a high end cryo-TEM, 
and a new focused ion beam (FIB) instrument. </p>
<p>The current efforts to extract natural gas and oil from shale successions require 
long term efforts of excellence in shale and shale gas research, coupled with 
top-notch training of the next generation of geoscience professionals. 
Sponsorship of the IU Shale Research Lab provides industry with access to 
cutting edge shale research, and helps to turn out the most comprehensively 
trained shale-focused geoscientists available. A research prospectus can be 
downloaded from this link: <b>
