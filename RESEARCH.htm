sedimentary column on Earth, and are nonetheless the least understood 
sedimentary rock type. The lion's share of the sedimentary rock record consists 
of shales and mudstones. Although still only a footnote in most soft rock 
curricula, there are a number of very good reasons to study shales and 
mudstones. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>First,</b></u> in order to <b> <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
			<i>read the rock record correctly</i></span> </b>and at the highest detail 
possible, we have to learn how to &quot;read&quot; shales. Understanding their deposition 
is key to the reconstruction of past oceans, landscapes, climates, and climatic 
cycles. Yet, whereas students of sandstones and carbonates have been able to 
learn a great deal about the deposition of these rocks from studying bedforms 
and sedimentary structures in the context of experimental data and direct 
observations in modern environments, the situation is not as fortunate when we 
examine our current knowledge concerning shales and mudstones. The situation is 
			changing rapidly, however, driven in part by the flume research that 
			we are conducting at IU.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Second,</b></u> regardless whether they contain a fraction of a percent or several 
ten percent of organic matter, mudstones and shales are the <b> 
			<span style="background-color: #C0C0C0"><i>source of the 
hydrocarbons that fuel the world economy</i></span>.</b> Furthermore, the seals that keep 
hydrocarbons in their reservoir, protect groundwater resources, and contain 
dangerous industrial waste products are all made of the same stuff - shales and 
mudstones.&nbsp;And finally, the technological advances in horizontal drilling 
			and hydraulic fracturing have made it feasible to exploit the vast 
			hydrocarbon reserves (gas and even liquids) that are stored in carbonaceous shale units in the US 
			and elsewhere. This new reality has changed the study of shales from 
			an academic past time to a matter of utmost economic importance. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><b>Third,</b></u> <b> 
			<span style="font-style: italic; background-color: #C0C0C0">shales are not restricted to the planet Earth</span>.</b> Several years ago 
evidence of layered rocks that show differential weathering of soft vs hard 
strata was discovered on Mars (Malin, M.C., and Edgett, K.S., 2000, Sedimentary 
rocks of early Mars, Science, v. 290, p. 1927-1937). Considering that much of 
the Martian sediments were derived from weathering of basalts, it is not a 
stretch to expect that the soft weathering intervals of Martian stratigraphy are 
clay dominated and consist of rocks that on Earth would be called mudstones. The 
2004 MER rovers also brought us images of sediment layers that are so fine 
grained that they are probably mudstones, and images of flaky weathering 
sediments that on Earth would most likely be identified as a shale or shaley 
siltstone. Finally the latest rover to explore Mars, Mars Science Lab/Curiosity 
			that touched down in August 2012, has located bona fide mudstones 
			just 450 m distant from its landing site and is now en route to a 
			location where we hope to find more mudstones and also sedimentary 
			sulfate/evaporite deposits. At the moment the rover is traversing 
			rough terrane to reach that locality, probably in the Fall of 2014.&nbsp; </font><font size="2"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" id="table7" border="1" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="30%" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">

			<p><font size="4">In addition to finding mudstones on Mars, the 
suggestion that the Hyugens probe that touched down on Titan on January 5th 2005 
came to rest on a surface that consists of a mix of wet clay and ice boulders 
gives us hope that there are more mudstones to be found in the solar system, and 
possibly elsewhere. To &quot;boldly go where no one has looked before&quot; (to paraphrase 
a line from Star Trek), has been a very 
rewarding approach to my studies of shales and it seems that the best is yet to 
come. Basically I think that shales are fascinating rocks, and that there is 
much we can learn from them about planetary history and geologic processes. 
Recent funding success is making it possible now to pursue sophisticated 
petrographic studies by means of a state of the art
<a href="FACILITIES.htm#SEM-ESEM_LAB">environmental SEM</a>, and experimental sedimentology 
with <a href="FACILITIES.htm#IU_MUDFLUME">flumes</a> specifically designed for working with muds.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="images/shale%20general/RESEAR4.gif" width="466" height="240" align="left" alt="sediment transport cartoon">My 
research is characterized by a holistic approach to shales, and consists of an 
integration of field studies (facies, stratigraphy) and lab studies (thin 
sections, electron microscopy, geochemistry) in order to understand the various 
factors that are involved in the formation of shales. Shales that I had an 
opportunity to study with this approach range in age from Proterozoic to Eocene 
and come from the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup of Montana, the Cambrian Wheeler 
Shale of Utah, the Ordovician Athens Shale of Alabama, the Devonian Chattanooga 
Shale of Tennessee, the Triassic Moenkopi Formation of Utah, the Posidonia Shale 
of Germany, the Mancos Shale of Utah, and the Green River Formation of Wyoming. 
In addition to my broad interest in shales, I am also curious about the 
formation of sedimentary mineral deposits and the diagenesis of sediments.
