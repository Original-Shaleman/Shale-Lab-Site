			<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial">Microbes are all around us. In 
			terms of numbers they rule the earth, and they manage to live under 
			extreme conditions, such as in hot springs, in polar ice, at depth 
			in rock formations, and in any conceivable environment in between. 
			Of interest for this paper are microbes that colonize, stabilize, 
			and modify the surfaces of sandy and muddy sediments. Microbial mat 
			deposits in carbonates are excluded, although the vast majority of 
			published examples is found in that rock type.</font><p>
			<font face="Arial">Modern microbial mats on sandy sediment surfaces 
			are well documented. The microbial colonization of muddy surfaces, 
			although less known, can be readily observed in modern puddles a few 
			days after a rainstorm. Essentially, for any sedimentary surface 
			there is likely a microbial community that is equipped to thrive 
			there if sedimentation rates are sufficiently small. Some can even 
			prosper in absence of sunlight, or in the harsh and dry conditions 
			of deserts.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Considering how many times the &quot;present has 
			been the key to the past&quot;, it stands to reason that numerous ancient 
			sand and mud surfaces were colonized by microbial communities. Thus, 
			we may assume that sandstone and mudstone deposits of the geologic 
			record should abound with microbial mat deposits</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">It is at this point that an old geologic truth 
			asserts itself once again: &quot;just because something should have 
			existed does not mean that it has been preserved&quot;. Positively 
			proving the former presence of microbial mats in sedimentary rocks 
			of any kind is actually quite a formidable task. Even in modern 
			microbial mat systems, all remnants of the constructing microbiota 
			may be destroyed within the first few hundred years of burial. 
			Furthermore, if one applies strict criteria of biogenicity, such as 
			preserved filaments in live position to published examples of fossil 
			microbial mats (or stromatolites), only a very small portion can 
			actually be shown to have a clearly demonstrable organosedimentary 
			origin.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">So, what is a sedimentologist to do? Simply 
			play it safe and assume that a given laminated sediment is not of 
			microbial origin because proof positive is missing? Maybe we should 
			look at the question from a different angle. In trace fossils, for 
			example, the animal that produced the fossil is typically not 
			preserved in association with the burrow. There is no dispute, 
			however, that the traces were produced by a variety of animals, and 
			that traces can be considered &quot;fossilized behavior&quot;. As these 
			animals were searching for food or seeking shelter, they invariably 
			modified the sediment and produced trace fossils that record the 
			interaction of the animal with the sediment. Likewise, laminated 
			sediments produced by microbial mats can be considered the &quot;trace&quot; 
			that reflects the interaction of the mat community with the 
			environment.</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><a href="mudstone-mats.htm">Microbial Mats in Mudstones</a> 
			(and sandstones)</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, laminated sediments can just as 
			well be produced by purely physical sedimentation processes. Thus, 
			there is a need to develop criteria for the identification of 
			microbial mat laminae. The best place to start looking for microbial 
			mat deposits in sandstones and mudstones is the Proterozoic. Its 
			biosphere was dominated by microorganisms and the bulk of all 
			published microbial mat deposits (stromatolites), albeit in 
			carbonates, come from that time period. In the Phanerozoic, of 
			course, bioturbation and grazing had a negative impact on the 
			preserved biomat record.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if one starts looking around, 
			one finds that even today, microbial films and mats abound in many 
			sedimentary environments.&nbsp; In fact, it is hard to look at many 
			aqueous environments without finding that sediment particles and 
			sediment surfaces in many instances carry microbial communities. The 
			resulting bio-films render the surface slippery (as most of us know 
			from experience), bind particles together, and change the chemistry 
			of the underlying sediments.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Just for entertainment purposes I am showing 
			in the space below microbial features that I noticed along a 
			small stream near Sulphur, Oklahoma.&nbsp; Although streams are normally 
			not thought of as suitable habitats for microbial mats, in this 
			particular case we are dealing with a&nbsp; spring fed stream that has 
			only a small suspended sediment load (would have negative impact on 
			mat).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial">Within this stream, and especially close to 
			the origin of the springs, the entire stream bed may be covered with 
			microbial covers that can reach several mm thickness, and may show 
			morphologies reflective of flow conditions.</font></td>
